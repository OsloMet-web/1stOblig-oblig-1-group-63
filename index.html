    <h1>DATA1200 Introduction</h1>
    <p>DATA1200 is an introduction to HTML and CSS, and the Accessibility-guidelines WCAGLinks to an external site.. Few
        people currently code directly in HTML, CSS. Rather, we use tools that create HTML and CSS for us; content
        management platforms, low- code or even no-code tools. However, a basic knowledge about web languages, design
        and possibilities are expected by most employers. After all, HTML, CSS and JS are the foundation of the Web. And
        when you learn JavaScript next semester (in DATA1700), you must know some basic HTML. The majority of bachelor
        thesis will have a webpage as a customer-facing interface.</p>
    <p>You enter this subject with very different backgrounds and qualifications. While there is no mandatory curriculum
        for this course, we must remind you that the classes itself are not meant to be enough for you to pass the exam.
        At university level, you must take responsibility for your own learning! And that includes seeking out
        supplementary information, dependent on your needs.</p>
    <h2>Course Materials</h2>
    <p>Lecture-notes are published in Canvas. In addition to that, you can also find basic courses on different
        platforms, if you prefer that to books or long texts. W3C has introductory courses on edX, irregular
        starting-dates. These may be helpfull if you have limited previous knowledge.</p>
